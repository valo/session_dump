SessionDump
===========

This is a small plugin, which allows the controllers to easily dump the current session at each request.


Example
=======

Here it is how it is used:

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include SessionDump
end

This will cause all the controllers inheriting from ApplicationController to dump their session data after each request.
